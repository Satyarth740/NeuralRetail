## Problem Statement

Retail businesses generate large volumes of transactional data every day. However, extracting meaningful insights from this data remains a challenge.

Some common business questions include:

* Who are our most valuable customers?
* Which customers are likely to stop purchasing?

## Customer Segmentation Module

Customer behavior was analyzed using RFM metrics:

* Recency → How recently a customer purchased
* Frequency → How often a customer purchased
* Monetary → Total amount spent

After feature scaling, K-Means Clustering was applied to identify meaningful customer groups.

### Generated Segments

| Segment     | Description                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Champions   | Recent, frequent, and high-spending customers |
| Loyal       | Consistent repeat customers                   |
| High Value  | Customers contributing significant revenue    |
| Hibernating | Inactive or low-engagement customers          |

### Business Benefits

* Personalized marketing campaigns
* Customer retention strategies
* Improved customer lifetime value
* Better targeting of promotions
